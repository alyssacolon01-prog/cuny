			<p class="intro">In New York City, there are 25 public CUNY’S campuses across all five boroughs, with <a href="https://www.cuny.edu/admissions/associate-degrees/#:~:text=NYC's%20Most%20Affordable%2C&text=You%20don't%20have%20to,earn%20associate%20degrees%20for%20free.">a degree being the most affordable.</a> CUNY’s four-year degree program may not be as cheap as a two-year degree, costing<a href="https://www.cuny.edu/financial-aid/tuition-and-college-costs/">$3,465 per semester </a>
for full-time New York State residents. We still saw a spike in student enrollment in higher education, especially after the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted. The reason for the highr spike in graduates is due to financial help.

<p>Due to the lockdown, not only CUNY but also SUNY responded to the pandemic by helping students financially. They distributed a combined <a href="https://www.budget.ny.gov/pubs/archive/fy23/ex/agencies/appropdata/CityUniversityofNewYork.html#:~:text=Responding%20to%20the%20Pandemic&text=Both%20systems%20rose%20to%20the,for%20more%20than%2052%2C000%20students.">$1.4 billion in emergency grants to students</a> from three federal stimulus bills: the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations (CRRSA) Act, and the American Rescue Plan (ARP) Act.
